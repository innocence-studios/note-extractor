# note-extractor
Extracts notes of an audio.

To make it work, add a file `audio.wav`, modify `main.py`'s constant `bpm` to the audio bpm.

Run main.py, then open `index.html` (works better with Ritwick Dey's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Upload `out.audio`.
